This project is a comprehensive healthcare management system designed to streamline the processes of patient care, doctor management, and medical prescriptions. It begins with the registration of an admin, who can then authorize and log in to the system. 
The admin can register clerks, add doctors with their specializations, and manage patient information. 
The system allows for the addition of medicines, creation of prescriptions, and assignment of patients to doctors. 
Medicines can be prescribed to patients, and prescriptions are linked to billing information.
The project culminates in a feature that retrieves all relevant patient data through a single API call, providing a holistic view of patient records and interactions
